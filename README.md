# simple python dictionary

A sample dictionary application by using basics of python I studied.
I am using a data.json file as my source for the dictionary operation and
have added some tweaks on app.py so that the program can operate as a proper dictionary

## Installing

* installation not required.
* will have to run app.py file by using "python3 app.py" command on terminal.

## Built With

* working environment : local
* Python 3 (with json package)
